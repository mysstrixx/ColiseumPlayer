Requirements:
python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Installation:
Download and put folder anywhere
Open this folder, go to address bar, type cmd
In the command line window that pops up type ColiRun.py
This should start the script
Script can be exited by holding down escape key
Submit any issues to this github

Info:
Script will play the colisum for you
It assumes you have 3 dragons and checks for both melee and magic skills
It will prefer to use skills and if it can't it will use scratch or meditate
If it sees the Fight On button it will click it

Very basic, requires full manual oversight, cannot complete the captcha for you.
Your dragons will die if you don't babysit it.

This is not an "auto-player" or a "hack". 
It is an automation script for low-mobility users or those who have wrist pain.
Still, use at your own risk. It should not be detectable but I cannot guarantee it.

You may need to manually edit the resolution, target locations, et cetera.
I did my best to make it look for images and click them or near them,
but it might need help finding those images if you resolution is different so be aware:
if it can't find anything that's why.

Important note:
This script was made fully by machine learning. 
Support can only be provided as far as asking the machine learning tool questions about submitted issues.
